# Airtable ETL

This repository contains template pipelines for:

* Putting data that meets certain criteria into an existing Airtable base as a new table
* Putting Airtable data that meets certain criteria into BigQuery

If your use case fits one of these templates, you can simply add a new configuration json to <tk> or <tk>.
Otherwise, hopefully these pipelines are a useful starting point for further development.
